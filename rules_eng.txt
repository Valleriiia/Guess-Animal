Rules of game "Animals"

Thinking mode:

Think of an animal and  press enter.  Answer the game's  questions with 'yes' or
'no' or 'y' or 'n'. If the game doesn't guess your animal,  enter the animal you
were thinking  of and a  question that  distinguishes your  animal from  the one
suggested by  the game.  The question  should be  such that  the answer for your
animal is 'yes,' and for the animal suggested by the game, it is 'no.'

Guessing mode:

The game thinks of a certain animal  that you have to guess  by asking questions
about  its  characteristics or  making  guesses  about  its  name.  You can  ask
questions that  the game will  answer with 'yes' or  'no,' or make guesses about
the animal. The game ends when you guess the animal or decide to quit.
